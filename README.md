# Campus_analytics_challenge

Challenge Criteria: Build a model to predict transaction categories using the 10 (ten) distinct categories that a transaction may fall into. The categories are as follows:

• Communication Services 
• Education 
• Entertainment
• Finance 
• Health and Community Service 
• Property and Business Services

The dataset provided on the Challenge page is synthetic. This dataset has been scrubbed to replace all transaction numbers with 1's.

Training Dataset – The Training Dataset contains 40,000 unique transactions and their corresponding transaction categories. This dataset should be used to develop your solution.

Test Dataset – The Test Dataset contains 10,000 unique transactions with the transaction categories omitted. This dataset should be used to test your solution and identify the correct transaction categories.

Challenge Instructions and Requirements: When creating your Solution, you may use a novel combination of existing Machine Learning and/or Natural Language Processing or develop your own novel method in order to extract and/or represent thematic information from the data file.
