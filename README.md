The dataset provided on the Challenge page is synthetic. This dataset has been scrubbed to replace all transaction numbers with 1's.

Training Dataset – The Training Dataset contains 40,000 unique transactions and their corresponding transaction categories. This dataset should be used to develop your solution.

Test Dataset – The Test Dataset contains 10,000 unique transactions with the transaction categories omitted. This dataset should be used to test your solution and identify the correct transaction categories.
